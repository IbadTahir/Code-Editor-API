# Local Storage Code Editor Feature

This document describes the new local storage functionality added to the Code Editor without affecting any backend APIs or frontend functionality.

## Features Added

### 1. Local Storage File Manager
- **Location**: Accessible via the üíæ button in the code editor toolbar
- **Purpose**: Save, load, and manage code files locally in the browser

### 2. File Management
- **Save Individual Files**: Save the currently active file to local storage
- **Import Files**: Import files from your device into the editor
- **Export Files**: Download saved files to your device
- **Delete Files**: Remove files from local storage

### 3. Project Management
- **Save Projects**: Save all current files as a project
- **Load Projects**: Load previously saved projects
- **Project History**: Track when projects were last modified

### 4. Recent Files
- **Quick Access**: View and load recently accessed files
- **Automatic Tracking**: Files are automatically added to recent list when saved

### 5. Storage Management
- **Usage Monitoring**: Visual progress bar showing storage usage
- **Storage Stats**: Display used storage and percentage
- **Clear Data**: Option to clear all local storage data

## How to Use

### Saving Files
1. Click the üíæ button in the code editor toolbar
2. Navigate to the "Files" tab
3. Click "üíæ Save File"
4. Enter a filename and click "Save"

### Loading Files
1. Open the Local Storage Manager (üíæ button)
2. Browse saved files in the "Files" tab
3. Click the üìÅ button next to any file to load it

### Importing Files
1. Open the Local Storage Manager
2. Click "üìÇ Import" button
3. Select a file from your device
4. The file will be imported and opened in the editor

### Managing Projects
1. Create multiple files in the editor
2. Open Local Storage Manager
3. Click "üìÅ Save Project"
4. Enter a project name
5. All current files will be saved as a project

### Accessing Recent Files
1. Open Local Storage Manager
2. Click the "Recent" tab
3. Click üìÅ button next to any recent file to load it

## Technical Details

### Storage Backend
- Uses browser's `localStorage` API
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Storage limit: ~5MB (browser dependent)

### File Structure
- Files are stored with metadata (size, language, timestamp)
- Projects contain multiple files with active file tracking
- Recent files list maintains last 10 accessed files

### Supported File Types
- Python (.py)
- JavaScript (.js)
- TypeScript (.ts)
- Go (.go)
- C++ (.cpp, .c)
- Java (.java)
- Rust (.rs)
- HTML (.html)
- CSS (.css)
- JSON (.json)
- XML (.xml)
- Markdown (.md)
- Text (.txt)

### Auto-detection
- File language is automatically detected from file extension
- Appropriate syntax templates are applied

## Integration Notes

### Non-Intrusive Design
- ‚úÖ No changes to existing backend APIs
- ‚úÖ No changes to existing frontend functionality
- ‚úÖ All existing features work exactly as before
- ‚úÖ Local storage is completely optional

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing code editor features remain unchanged
- Users can continue using the editor without local storage
- Local storage enhances but doesn't replace existing functionality

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of storage quota exceeded
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback behavior when localStorage is unavailable

## Benefits

1. **Offline Capability**: Save work locally without server dependency
2. **Quick Access**: Rapidly access frequently used files
3. **Backup**: Local backup of important code snippets
4. **Project Organization**: Group related files together
5. **Enhanced Workflow**: Import/export files seamlessly
6. **No Server Load**: Reduces server storage requirements

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- File versioning/history
- Folder organization
- Search functionality within saved files
- Sync with cloud services
- Collaborative features
- Code templates library

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Edge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è IE11 (limited support)

## Limitations

- Storage limited by browser localStorage quota (~5MB)
- Data is tied to specific browser/domain
- No cross-device synchronization (local only)
- Data can be cleared by user/browser cleanup

## Security Considerations

- Data stored locally in browser only
- No transmission to external servers
- User has full control over their data
- Can be cleared at any time by user
